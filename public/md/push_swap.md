## Overview

This project involves sorting data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, and the smallest number of moves. acquiring the skills to manipulate various sorting algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution(s) for optimized data sorting is essential.

## Requirements :

-   The program must be written in C, a Makefile must be provided.
-   Memory leaks are not to be tolerated.
-   You have two stacks; a and b, initialy a is full and be is empty.
-   There is only a limited set of instruction possible (swap a, swap b, swap a b, push a, push b, rotate a, rotate b, rotate a b, reverse rotate a, reverse rotate b, reverse rotate a b).
-   You have to implement a sorting algorithm.
-   Your program must the smallest list of instructions possible to sort the stack a, the smallest number being at the top.
-   Stack b must be empty at the end of the program.
-   100 random numbers have to be sorted in under 700 instruction.
-   Each instruction must be displayed.
-   500 random numbers have to be sorted in under 5500 instruction.
-   Display an error in case something goes wrong.
-   As a bonus implement a checker program that reads instruction and displays OK if sorted, KO otherwise.
