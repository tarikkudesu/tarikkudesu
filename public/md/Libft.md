## Overview

This project is about understanding and reimplementing some highly usefull c function into my own c library that will be used throughout the upcomming projects.

## Requirements :

-   This project must be written in C, a Makefile must be provided.
-   Your Makefile should be able to compile a library. You must use the command ar to create your library.
-   You have to redo a set of functions from libc, they must have the same behavior as the original function. plus some additional functions for string manipulation, add them to your library.
-   As a bonus, you have to create a set of function for manipulating linked lists (creating, adding, removing, clearingâ€¦), add them to you library.
