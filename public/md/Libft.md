## Overview

This project is about understanding and reimplementing some highly usefull c function that will be bundled into a library to be used throughout the upcomming projects.

## Requirements :

-   This project is implemented in c and is compilable with a makefile.
-   The Makefile compiles a library with the command `ar`.
-   The library contains a set of reimplemented functions from libc that have the same behavior as the original ones. plus some additional functions for string manipulation.
-   As a bonus, The library also contains a set of function for manipulating linked lists (creating, adding, removing, clearingâ€¦).

## New Concepts

-   Pointers
-   Arrays and Strings
-   Manual Memory Management
-   Stack / heap
-   Compilation and Linking
-   Preprocessor Directives
-   Structs and Typedefs
-   Undefined Behavior & Safety Risks
-   Bitwise Operations
