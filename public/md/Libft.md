## Overview

This project is about understanding and reimplementing some highly useful c function that will be bundled into a library to be used throughout the upcoming projects.

## Description

-   This project is implemented in c and is compilable with a Makefile.
-   The Makefile compiles a library with the command `ar`.
-   The library contains a set of reimplemented functions from libc that have the same behavior as the original ones. Plus some additional functions for string manipulation.
-   As a bonus, The library also contains a set of function for manipulating linked lists (creating, adding, removing, clearingâ€¦).

## New Concepts

-   Pointers.
-   Arrays and Strings.
-   Manual Memory Management.
-   Stack / heap.
-   Compilation and Linking.
-   Preprocessor Directives.
-   Structs and Typedefs.
-   Undefined Behavior & Safety Risks.
-   Bitwise Operations.
